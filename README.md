# Pizza Parlor
This project was one of my firsts in front-end web development. It is a landing page for my fictitious pizza restaurant.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS
I didn't even have VSCode when I made this landing page, which is my default text editor these days. I used CodePen, floats, and tutorials from freeCodeCamp.org to create this project.

## Lessons Learned:
I was under the impression that HTML and CSS were the "easiest" languages to learn as a beginner. What I learned by working on this project was that there is more to web design than meets the eye. Going back, I realized how much of a mess the original code was - incomplete, unnecessary and unused attributes, and elements covering other elements
